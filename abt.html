    <h1>Our Company: The Pokemon Rankers</h1>
    <h2>The Pokemon Rankers were made in 2010. Created by pokemonsweat2025(justacap) and his team, pokemonsweat2024 and pokemonsweat2023. Through hard struggle and dedication, they created a company, the Pokemon Rankers. They made this company in hopes of showing the world the Top 5 Pokemon and to make others agree with their agenda. For extra info: they used to sell Pokemon cards but stopped after a while. Also gave tutorials on how to beat Pokemon games.
